Kamerons Projects:

This is a repository to showcase projects ove worked on.

Ive formatted it to be a webpage that potential employers can look at, read about me and gain access to my projects

on the homepage you will find an appealing page that will show the purpose of the site ive created and catch the eye of potential customers and/or employers

the about me page will have photos of me, some information about my personal life, and some information about my previous work experience.

The portfolio page will have pictures of the websites and other projects of created on my own, and descriptions of those projects. i hope to also have links here that will take the user to my git hub page so they can look into these projects in more detail
